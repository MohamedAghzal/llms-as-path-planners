Generate a path to navigate from the initial location to the goal location similarly to the examples below. Think step by step.
###
Description in code:

#The goal is to navigate from the initial location to all goals while avoiding obstacles (marked with 1)
 
obstacles = []
goals = [(23, 15)]
initial_location = [24, 19]

for i in range((17, 22)):
    for j in range((11, 16)):
        obstacles.append([i,j])
        
for i in range((1, 9)):
    for j in range((1, 14)):
        obstacles.append([i,j])
        
for i in range((7, 22)):
    for j in range((0, 21)):
        obstacles.append([i,j])
        
Solution: up left left left left
