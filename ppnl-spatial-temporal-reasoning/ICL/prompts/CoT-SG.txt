Provide a sequence of actions to navigate a world to reach a goal similarly to the examples below. (0,0) is located in the upper-left corner and (M, N) lies in the M row and N column.
###
Task: You are in a 6 by 6 world. There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (2,1). Go from (0,1) to (3,4)
Actions: (3,4) is 3 steps down and 3 steps to the right of (0,1). To avoid the obstacle at (2,1), which is 2 steps down from (0,1), I should start by moving right. Therefore, my action sequence is: right right right down down down.
###
Task: You are in a 6 by 6 world. There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (1,5) and (1,2). Go from (5,4) to (0,5)
Actions: (0,5) is 5 steps up and 1 step to the right of (5,4). To avoid the obstacle at (1,5), which is 4 steps up and 1 step to the right from (5,4), I should move right last.  Therefore, my action sequence is: up up up up up right.
###
Task: You are in a 6 by 6 world. There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (0,3), (2,5) and (5,2). Go from (4,2) to (0,5)
Actions: (0,5) is 4 steps up and 3 steps to the right of (4,2). I can start by going up. To avoid the obstacle at (0,3), which is 4 steps up and 1 step to the right of (4,2), I should take a right at (1,3). Therefore my action sequence is: up up up right right up right 
###
You are in a 6 by 6 world. There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (3,5), (4,2), (3,3) and (0,4). Go from (1,5) to (3,1)
Actions: (3,1) is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps to the right of (1,5). No obstacles fall on this path. Therefore my action sequence is: left left left left down down.
###
Task: You are in a 6 by 6 world. There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (2,5), (5,2), (0,4), (1,4) and (0,1). Go from (4,2) to (1,2)
Actions: (1,2) is 3 steps up from (4,2).  No obstacles fall on this path. Therefore my action sequence is: up up up.
###
Task: You are in a 6 by 6 world. There are obstacles that you have to avoid at: (0,4) and (1,5). Go from (0,5) to (1,1)
Actions: (0,5) is surrounded by obstacles. Therefore, the goal is not reachable from my location.
